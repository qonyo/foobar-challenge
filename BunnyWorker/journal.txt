brain fried, start again tomorrow XD

for tomorrow, try checking the pattern, I think there is some kind of numerical pattern there

I also have a feeling this will be a dynamic programming (self calling method) kind of thing

reread this for better understanding

turns out it's called triangle sequence where the following sites will explain it better:

if my logic below seems jumping a lot, I also put the following info into consideration:
https://math.wonderhowto.com/how-to/find-equation-for-growth-pattern-375048/

now I need to plug in f(x,y) into this problem better

let's just bruteforce everythin and see if I see any more pattern

since the 1,3,6,10 (x=1, y=n) pattern is :

n(n+1)/2
 
there is a good chance that the 1,2,4,7,11 (x=1) is: 
(n(n-1)/2) + 1 || n-1 gotten from how the slope/change is 1 less than 1,3,6,10 and 
+1 outside for 1 as starter(checked)

let's see (x=2, y=n) 3,5,8,12,17,23 and let's say that x started from 1 which make the pattern into:
(n(n-1)/2)+1) + (n+1)                             || n = y
^left side----   ^right side became a slope

wait I think this journal will become weird before I wrote the matrices
(I mainly used pen and paper)

1  3  6  10 15 21 ...
2  5  9  14 20 27 ...
4  8  13 19 26 34 ...
7  12 18 25 33 42 ...
11 17 24 32 41 51 ...
16 23 31 41 51 61 ...
.. .. .. .. .. ..

(basically this is a matric representation for the domain problem

Funnily enough the more right we go the right side will add more
in example 6 9 13 .. have this pattern (n as y):
now at this point we have n as x = 3 (we need to somehow include x here lol)

((n(n-1)/2)+1)+(n+2)+(n+1)

since the right side always adds when x adds let's say that 0/+1/+2 that have n influence int (let's try another approach)

x1 : (n^2-n+2)/2
x2 : (n^2+n+4)/2
x3 : (n^2+n+8)/2
x4 : (n^2+n+16)/2

I need more time for this one
