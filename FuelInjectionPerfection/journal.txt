This problem reminds me of 3n+1 problem see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

I believe the key to this problem is as follows:
1. look for the fastest way to the smallest 2^n number
2. because of 309 digits rule we need a fast computation method

Some observation :
the bigger we goes into the nitty gritty of hard number crunching I think it's good to write some observation
1. the higher we go the less 2^n number there is
2. I think that finding the fastest way to 2^n is key because each step will result in x/2 closer to 1
3. which means we might need to check modulo/ is it even or not
4. there might also be pattern of some special odd number having to be +1 or -1 (transform into even) which will result in the fastest way to 1
5. Why I think there is pattern? it's a competitive programming stuff, you are always expected to fine some interesting things here

I also think we might be able to use some dynamic programmin in this problem

let's try working with some test cases I think I will write some samples with paper to make it easier to jiggle some number around
so see you later.

after working for 10 samples I found out that the best way for an even number is to divide by 2 right away:

2 : 2, 1 		|| :2
3 : 3, 2, 1 || -1 
4 : 4, 2 , 1 ||:2
5 : 5, 4, 2, 1 || -1
6 : 6, 3, 2, 1 || :2
7 : 7, 8, 4, 2, 1 || 7, 6, 3, 2, 1 <= this case is flexible, that's why I wrote both so that I can find pattern faster || +- 1
8 : 8, 4, 2, 1 || :2
9 : 9, 8, 4, 2, 1 || :2
10 : 5,4,2,1 || :2
1 : 1

thus far I can't find a case where +1 at first step is advantageous instead of 7, say let's try it out to bigger number and 15 from readme

Expanded :
2 : 2, 1 		|| :2
3 : 3, 2, 1 || -1 
4 : 4, 2 , 1 ||:2
5 : 5, 4, 2, 1 || -1
6 : 6, 3, 2, 1 || :2
7 : 7, 8, 4, 2, 1 || 7, 6, 3, 2, 1 <= this case is flexible, that's why I wrote both so that I can find pattern faster || +- 1
8 : 8, 4, 2, 1 || :2
9 : 9, 8, 4, 2, 1 || -1
10 : 10,5,4,2,1 || :2
11 : 11, 12, 6, 3, 2, 1 || 11, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1 || +- 1
12 : 12, 6, 3, 2, 1 || :2
13 : 13, 12, 6, 3, 2, 1 || -1
14 : 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1 || :2
15 : 15, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 || 15, 14, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1 + 1 < must +, pattern break
16 : 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 || :2
17 : 17, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 || 17, 18, 9, 8, 4, 2, 1 || -1
18 : 18, 9, 8, 4, 2, 1 || :2
19 : 19, 18, 9, 8, 4, 2, 1 || 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1 || +- 1
20 : 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1 || :2

is every 5*3 multiplier always result in +1 first? since 5 or 3 multiplier unique doesn't have this problem
one thing for almost sure even is always divided by 2
