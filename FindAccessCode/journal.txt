usually in a competitive programming there will be a problem about dynamic programming

will this be the one?

too tired to copas the problem and make whole workspace, but basically it's about finding 
lucky triplet [x,y,z] where

y%x = 0
z%y = 0

right now I'm thinking of 2 approach

1. brute forcing by iterating and checking
2. using modulo inspired by sieve of eratosthenes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) <= not really sure about this one, but I felt like it might help efficiency
