I think we could map the map as a graph and solve the fastest path no matter the wall, then if there is only one wall it's solved
it's super naive and will fail though let's start like the usual and finish this manually

[
[0, 1, 1, 0], 
[0, 0, 0, 1], 
[1, 1, 0, 0], 
[1, 1, 1, 0]
]

[
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], 
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
